        <p className="lead fs-6">
          The Islamic League School in Finland was established to provide education services to Muslims residing in Finland of all categories and ages. The school aims to teach the Holy Qur’an, the Arabic language, and the principles of true Islam
          according to a moderate curriculum that enhances belonging to Islam and spreads a culture of love and peace by increasing awareness of tolerant Islamic principles.
        </p>
        <p className="lead fs-6">
          The school witnessed several stages, but work was launched in the school according to a modern and advanced mechanism at the beginning of the 2021-2022 academic year, where a new registration mechanism and modern teaching methods were
          adopted.
        </p>
        <p className="lead fs-6">
          The school employs qualified and experienced teachers, which helps them deliver their lofty message to the students with quality and mastery, ultimately aiming to improve the level of students and enhance their skills in reading and writing
          in the Arabic language to achieve the ability to recite the Holy Qur’an with perfection.
        </p>
        <p className="lead fs-6">
          The school provides its services to all Muslims residing in Finland, whether from Finns or from immigrant communities of all ages, and focuses on the young age group - namely school-age students - because they are the largest group in
          number and because they are the foundation of the future.

            The Holy Qur’an, the Arabic language, and Islamic culture are taught in the full academic year system from the beginning of fall to the end of spring of the following year, and vacations coincide with the general system of Finnish public
            schools.
          </p>
          <h5 className="mx-5">Mechanism for implementing the study</h5>
          <p className="lead mx-5 fs-6">A- The dual study system: lessons are held in school and remotely, where the Arabic language is taught on Saturday at school and the Holy Qur’an is taught on Sunday remotely via the Internet.</p>
          <p className="lead mx-5 fs-6">
            B- Distance learning system: The school is unique in providing this service among all the schools of the Holy Qur’an and Arabic language in Finland, which has led to the benefit of Muslim children residing in remote cities and remote
            villages that do not have a large Muslim community that allows lessons to be held there. To register for the school, click here
