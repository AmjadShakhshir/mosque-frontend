        <p className="lead">
          The Islamic Association in Finland was established in 1986 and was registered at the beginning of 1987 as the second official Islamic religious association in Finland. The registration was made with the approval of the Ministry of Education
          based on the Finnish Freedom of Religion Act of 1923. Every Muslim man or woman residing in Finland can join the association, regardless of their original language. Membership continues even if the resident changes his place of residence
          unless he resigns. In 2020, the association is considered the second largest Islamic association in Finland, which includes Muslims of all ethnic and linguistic backgrounds, in addition to Muslims of Finnish origin. The majority of the
          association&apos;s members hold Finnish citizenship. The Association is a founding member of the Finnish Islamic Council.
